    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">January</h5>
    <p>25 January 2018: Worked on Redmine Task#877 Weird message needs to be investigated. Jena reasoner was updated, so that if an error occurs,it throws an exception with a meaningful message. 3MEditor shows this message and (hopefully) guides 
        user to fix things... (Will require further feedback)

    <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">2017</h4>


    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">November</h5>
    <p>28 November 2017: Fixed an issue we had when filling attribute input fields with '<' (It broke underlying XML).</p>
    <p>27 November 2017: Fixed Redmine Bug#778 (When adding new map, following maps index does not get updated as it should.)
    </p>
    <p>24 November 2017: Updated our code to work with https:// and also URLs ending with '/' (Redmine Bug#774 - 
        Combo values issues with https:// or ending with /). Also improved error messages when Jena reasoner fails to 
        produce results to fill in combo (Redmine Task#772 - Avoid meaningless error messages when something goes wrong).</p>
    <p>22 November 2017: Fixed ancient Redmine Bug#724 (Deleting a target intermediate causes visual issues (extra entity types))</p>
    <p>10 November 2017: Decided to remove disabling all buttons while posting to the server (created more problems than it actually solved).
        Added loading state for buttons adding stuff. Fixed title in domain context menu.</p>
    <p>06 November 2017: User may not select links and domains at the same time, to avoid invalid state (deleting domain with links). Made selection borders thicker
        (from 2px to 4px) to avoid issues with users (e.g. Maria) working 3MEditor with zoom less than 100%.
    <p>03 November 2017: Attempt to disable buttons while waiting for action to complete caused problems (it also disabled input fields, losing focus etc).
        So, changed it to button elements ONLY.</p>
    <p>01 November 2017: Fixing issues related with broader-exact_match rules. Fixed nasty Redmine Bug#438
        (the one with generator args not appearing). Started work on Copy Map(s)-Link(s).</p>

    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">October</h5>

    <p>26 October 2017: Deleting multiple maps or links functional! Added opacity change in all POST requests (waiting user feedback). Also, disabling buttons on click in all POST requests, to avoid multiple clicks
        while waiting.</p>
    <p>25 October 2017: <b>Release 3.2</b>. Added Redmine Task#372 (Update 3MEditor to use x3ml schema version 1.3 - and therefore x3ml Engine 1.8.2).
        Added 2 new elements in if block (broader and exact_match) and an attribute in x3ml to indicate 3MEditor version.</p>
    <p>24 October 2017: Added Redmine Task#375 (Same value for source relation and source node). This only happens if source_node is empty, 
        to avoid accidental overwrites. Also added http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime to the Literal Generators list.</p>
    <p>23 October 2017: Addressed Redmine Bug#179 (Transformation Error messages). Increased timeout for specific action to 1 minute.
        Used to be 20seconds and also added a fail handler to stop process gracefully. (hiding loader and showing a message in console) </p>   
    <p>20 October 2017: Added Redmine Feature#180 (Automatically assign the Literal generator to all Literals). Fixed 
        the ":" issue we had with values such as :http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Literal. Fixed Redmine Bug#173 
        (1st link after domain has absolute instead of relative path)</p>
    <p>13 October 2017: Fixed Redmine Bug#177 (I have loaded a sample source file and I have done a transform. I go to info tab,
        change source file and immediately go to transform. It has still the old file and I need to reload the screen.)
        Also renewed 3MTidy jar to fix Redmina Bug#176 (Files contained in schemata_list.xml deleted)</p>
    <p>05 October 2017: RDFVisualizer URL is now a parameter in web.xml. When calling RDFVisualizer only one tab is used.</p>
    <p>03 October 2017: Adding extra info in web.xml to make Windows/Linux setup simpler. Removing useless targetRecordsFolder param.</p>

    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">August</h5>
    <p>24 August 2017: Improving namespaces behavior and auto repairing file.</p>
    <p>03 August 2017: Updating x3ml engine used (1.8.1). Fixed generator policy file size issue.</p>

    <p>13 July 2017: Fixed a bug: When deleting a NOT if-rule (inequality or nonexistence), entire target_relation block was deleted too! </p>

    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">May</h5>
    <p>30 May 2017: Fixed a bug (not showing xpaths in source links, when there was an if-rule in domain). Also
        shortened source domain xpaths when starting with // to reduce table cell width.
        Fixed "upload source schema" bug. Hiding "Delete source" when there is only one!
    <p>24 May 2017: Fixed XML bug when editing RAW XML in Generators tab.</p>

    <p>11 May 2017: Hiding html upload in example source record (Maria's suggestion), since it was not used
        and created visual issues (sometimes).</p>

    </p>
    <p>03 Apr 2015: Changed whole upload mechanism. Now checking for duplicates and if found file is not uploaded and is replaced by its
        duplicate. Also added better exception handling for schema queries and possible target-namespace mismatch. Changed source analyzer service.</p>
    <p>02 Apr 2015: At last added listener code that removes any unused or duplicate files from server and DB on sessionDestroyed.
        Added message if source analyzer cannot read source schema or example xml (some mappings had rdf files with extension .xml as source
        schema, for example Mapping2). Scroll editable block to top of page so that user does not get lost.
    </p>
    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">March</h5>
    <p>27 Mar 2015: Added source analyzer functionality! Works with xml files at the moment.

    <p>23 Mar 2015: Added instance_generation mode. Added about tab to keep track of changes.
        Fixed a nasty, hard to detect bug (when deleting one of multiple entries and shifting positions, input values were
        lost! XML was fine, so when user refreshed page, everything was fine.)
