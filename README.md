# README #

The repository contains the necessary resources that are required for creating a docker image of Mapping Memory Manager (3M) web platform. 

The image is build upon the docker image for openjdk from [openjdk:8-jre](https://hub.docker.com/_/java/)

## 3M

The 3M is a web application suite containing several software sub-components and exploiting several external services.
Its main functionality is to assist users during the mapping definition process, using a human-friendly user interface and a set of sub-components that either suggest or validate the user input.
More information about 3M and its related components can be found at http://www.ics.forth.gr/isl/X3MLToolkit

## 3M image Building Blocks

3M Docker image is being constructed using  the docker image for jre8 from openjdk ([openjdk:8-jre](https://hub.docker.com/_/java/)).
Apart from Java 3M requires the following: 

* [eXist-DB](https://exist-db.org/) is an open source NoSQL database built on XML technology. It is classified as both a NoSQL Document database and a native XML database. eXist provides XQuery and XSLT as its query and application programming languages. 3M Docker image uses eXist-DB-2.2 which is being downloaded from bintray (https://bintray.com/artifact/download/existdb/releases/eXist-db-setup-2.2.jar)
* [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) is  is an open source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and Java WebSocket technologies. 3M docker image uses Apache Tomcat 8.0.47 which is being downloaded from Apache Tomcat miror download pages (http://ftp.cc.uoc.gr/mirrors/apache/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.0.47/bin/apache-tomcat-8.0.47.tar.gz)


## How to use

The image creates a running instance of Apache Tomcat, with the required 3M  webapps and resources allready shipped in, so that it can work as the underlying layer of 3M framework. The container starts tomcat container and listens for incoming connection at port 8080. The following environment variables are available for managing the apache tomcat container:

To start your container using port 8080 (for 3M webapps) and 8081 (for eXistdb):

```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 swissartresearx/3m-docker:latest
```

After running the container you can check if the instance is up and running by pasting the links below in your web browser

```
http://localhost:8080/3M
http://localhost:8081/exist
```

For maintability reasons, 3M docker image exposes the following volumes which are mounted in the filesystem where the container is running (for more infromation about the actual location of these volumes in the target filesystem use docker inspect command)
* data from eXist-DB
* 3M shared resources

### Docker Compose

The repository contains a docker-compose file that can be used to start the 3M container. To use the configuration, first create an `.env` file based on the example file `.env.example`, edit as required, and then run the following command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```
To use bind mounts uncomment the respective `COMPOSE_FILE` line in the `.env` file and create and initialise the required directories by running the `createFoldersForBindMounts.sh` script.
